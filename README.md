## About
This project one of the projects that are part of this [Udemy Fullstack Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/share/101qYw3@rVDSWDo3-UGDoum_nCZPdj5Nkvz2Gv3i7ZOUOgnL0e40ELty_A_ZRrY-fxeM2c7QNA==/). Using simple HTML and JavaScript, the purpose of this project is to get practice and experience in interacting and manipulating the JavaScript DOM. Taking key inputs and button clicks as inputs, the drum kit makes a variety of sounds. This is done through using the (most notably) HTMLAudioElement and ddEventListener tools in JavaScript.
